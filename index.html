The mission of the institution is to train linguists. The leadership at the Naval Postgraduate School (NPS) and DLIFLC crafted a solution that has resulted in the .edu network being extended to DLIFLC.  \nIn 2010, a pilot was conducted with one of the language schools to provide Army leadership with the data necessary to decide if the entire institution should transition to the .edu.  The pilot was a great success; students and faculty saw immediate improvement with the additional flexibility, and ability to access relevant content and use technologies that were not possible on the military networks.  The .edu network has greatly improved the ability to teach linguists how to speak, listen, and write.  \nThe Army created Language Training Detachments throughout (and beyond) the United States that serve as locations for linguists to obtain educational tools, to practice their skills, and to maintain proficiency.  These remote locations are also tasked with administering testing to confirm that proficiency levels are maintained.  \nIn October of 2013, the Augusta, GA detachment started a pilot .edu extension.  The detachment in Georgia was configured as a remote location utilizing the DLIFLC .edu resources.  The successes and challenges, remote administration, network architecture, and the maintenance/lifecycle replacement of systems are detailed in this presentation."},{"name":"Using Shibboleth to provide authenticated access for CSU Faculty, Staff, and Students on the SBCC campus Wifi network","url":"http://cenic2015.cenic.org/cenic-2015-conference-program-2/abstract-using-shibboleth-to-provide-authenticated-access-for-csu-faculty-staff-and-students-on-the-sbcc-campus-wifi-network/","start":"2015-03-09T14:00:00-07:00","end":"2015-03-09T14:20:00-07:00","description":"Presenter(s): Michael Ghens, Santa Barbara City College\nInstitutions will be asked to offer technology resources to other institutions.

The glove also provides a quantitative measure of hand function providing feedback to both patients and therapists.\nExergaming: A robust gaming system that transforms any piece of exercise equipment into a gaming controller, enabling injured and disabled individuals to control video games with their own specialized equipment. Exergaming systems are being deployed at the VA Hospital in Long Beach to encourage exercise among Spinal Cord Injury patients.\nWENDI: A complete hardware and software interface providing a standard communication protocol between all healthcare devices within the home and any internet enabled device (phones, tablets, TVs). WENDI connects all healthcare devices to the internet, allowing patients or doctors to monitor their health remotely.\nMusculoskeletal Dance Science Research Laboratory Science & Health in Artistic Performance, Kelli Sharp\nDancers typically exhibit capabilities of the musculoskeletal system that are considerably beyond those of the average person. They also are known to have an extremely high incidence of injury. In many ways these performers are athletes; thus, this laboratory is applying research principles used widely in sports medicine and collaborating with engineering and science disciplines to advance the field of performing arts medicine and science. The demonstrations will include biomechanical analysis of dancers balance stability assessment in dancers, and clinical measurements to evaluate predisposing factors of knee pain in dancers.\nMicro/Nano Fluidics, Abe Lee\nThe Center for Advanced Design and Manufacturing of Integrated Microfluidics (CADMIM) will advance research and education on the science, engineering, and applications of integrated microfluidic design and scalable production through dedicated, continuing industrial partnerships. This center has been devised to concentrate and deploy resources and people to launch a transformation in ubiquitous diagnostics by creating the design tools, methods, and manufacturing technologies that will enable low-cost, simple, rapid assessment anywhere and everywhere – the environment, agriculture, food and water supplies, and  ultimately for human health and safety.”\nCalPlug, Arthur Zhang\nThe California Plug Load Research Center (CalPlug) is the leading enabler for energy efficiency solutions in the use and design of appliances and consumer electronic devices. CalPlug is initially sponsored by the California Energy Commission and Regents of the University of California to promote a cleaner, more efficient State of California. The center focuses on emerging technologies and user behavior studies for plug load devices. CalPlug addresses challenges in plug load efficiency for both residential and commercial buildings by collaborating closely with utilities, manufacturers, advocacy groups, research institutions, and energy policy makers."},{"name":"Sponsor Reception","url":"http://cenic2015.cenic.org/cenic-2015-conference-program-2/","start":"2015-03-10T17:30:00-07:00","end":"2015-03-10T19:00:00-07:00"},{"name":"Breakfast","url":"http://cenic2015.cenic.org/cenic-2015-conference-program-2/","start":"2015-03-11T08:00:00-07:00","end":"2015-03-11T09:00:00-07:00"},{"name":"Of Mice and Elephants","url":"http://cenic2015.cenic.org/cenic-2015-conference-program-2/abstract-of-mice-and-elephants/","start":"2015-03-11T09:00:00-07:00","end":"2015-03-11T09:45:00-07:00","description":"Presenter(s): Josh Sonstroem, UC Santa Cruz\nThis presentation will review what “elephant flows” are and how can Science DMZ networks help with them.

Naturally, concerns are being raised about the security of the Science DMZ, as this model uses non-traditional security mechanisms. This presentation will discuss various techniques currently being employed to provide robust security for the Science DMZ.\nBy viewing the Science DMZ as a “security architecture,” the design can be tailored to mitigate the precise set of risks that arise with this model. The presentation will show how a Science DMZ model can improve the traditional security model of other systems, such as the systems that manage laboratory instruments. Additionally the presentation will show how SDN can provide granular flow management into and out of the Science DMZ."},{"name":"Morning Break","url":"http://cenic2015.cenic.org/cenic-2015-conference-program-2/","start":"2015-03-11T10:30:00-07:00","end":"2015-03-11T10:45:00-07:00"},{"name":"100G Open Source Network Monitoring with Bro and Time Machine ","url":"http://cenic2015.cenic.org/cenic-2015-conference-program-2/abstract-100g-open-source-network-monitoring-with-bro-and-time-machine/","start":"2015-03-11T10:45:00-07:00","end":"2015-03-11T12:00:00-07:00","description":"Presenter(s): Vincent Stoffer, Lawrence Berkeley Lab\nAs our high-speed networks have become vital tools for enhancing academic and scientific discoveries, the race continues to bigger pipes and faster connections.
